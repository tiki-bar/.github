# TIKI: Bar (aka R&D)
 üçª You've found our R&D org! [@TIKI](https://mytiki.com) we build decetralized infrastructure to create private, safe, and compliant data transactions between people and businesses. 
 We're committed to transparency and remaining 100% open source. The projects here are often experimental with much longer time horizons, many may never make it to production üò¢. 
 Docs are often light (or non-existent), tread carefully.
